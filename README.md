# Lab 3 - Flixster

**Flixster** is a movies app displaying box office and top rental DVDs using [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- The following screens use AutoLayout to adapt to various orientations and screen sizes
   - [x] Movie feed view (+3pt)
   - [x] Detail view (+2pt)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] Dynamic Height Cells (+1)
- [ ] Collection View AutoLayout (+2)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How figure out constaints for large scale projects
2. Working on manually inputting the constraints is better than auto doing it.

### Notes
I messed up once by adding a breakpoint randomly in the app, and I didn't know how to get rid of it.
